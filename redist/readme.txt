Release Naming Conventions:

Each release is kept in a folder which is then zipped or rarred by the name of the date of release and the version of the release.

042814a1 for example, is the release Alpha 1, which was released 04/28/2014

Version Prefixes:
a - Alpha Version
b - Beta Version
p - Production Version

Each release should also have a debug version, including tools which aren't normally redistributed with the dll.  This release name should always be the same as the primary release, but with debug appended to the name.  Continuing the previous example: 042814a1debug
